# Display the first few opponent choices
head(opponent_choices)

# Some notessssss from methods 4
When conducting a prior-posterior check, we wanna see how the data (evidence) has updated our initial beliefs (priors) to give  new beliefs (posteriors). The extent and nature of this update can give insights into the parameter's role in the model and how it relates to the observed data. It's also important to reflect on whether the posterior distributions make sense given our understanding of the process being modeled. If the posteriors are surprising or counterintuitive, it may warrant a deeper examination of both the data and the model's structure..

### Concluding on alpha
Prior distribution: The green area represents the prior distribution for alpha, which is a beta(1, 1) distribution. This is a uniform distribution across the range [0, 1], indicating that, prior to observing the data, we assumed all values of alpha to be equally likely.

Posterior distribution: The blue area represents the posterior distribution for alpha. It is centered around a value that is lower than 0.5, indicating that, after observing the data, our model has learned that lower values of alpha are more likely than lower values.

Interpretation of learning rate: The data has informed the model that the learning rate (alpha) is more likely to peak around 0.3, as indicated by the posterior distribution, which is centered in the lower third of the [0, 1] range. This suggests that the agent updates its value estimates with a moderate degree of responsiveness to prediction errors, rather than with a high degree of change. The shift from a non-informative, uniform prior indicates that the observed data led to a significant update in beliefs about the learning rate, moving away from the prior assumption of all values being equally likely towards a more specific likelihood of lower alpha values.

### Concluding on tau 
Prior distribution: The yellow area represents the prior distribution for tau, which is uniform(0, 10). As with alpha, we initially considered all values of tau within this range to be equally likely.

Posterior distribution: The red area represents the posterior distribution for tau. The distribution is much narrower and is centered around a value less than 2.5, indicating that the data has led the model to learn that lower values of tau are more likely.

Exploration vs. exploitation interpretation: Tau influences the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in decision-making. A lower tau value suggests that the agent's choices are less exploratory and more exploitative, meaning that the agent is more likely to choose the option it currently values higher.

### Prior-Posterior checks interpretation:
Informative data: The shift from the prior to the posterior distributions in both parameters indicates that our data is informative and is significantly updating our beliefs about the parameters.

Model fit: The lack of overlap between prior and posterior for tau suggests that the data has provided substantial information to update the beliefs about this parameter.

Conclusions: The model has learned specific characteristics about the learning rate and the temperature parameter from the data, which can be interpreted in the context of the behavior or process we are modeling.

## 4.2 Simulating data
Here we build a new simulation of random agents with bias and noise. The code and visualization is really nothing different from last weekâ€™s exercise.

```{r}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
        here,
        posterior,
        cmdstanr,
        brms, tidybayes)

trials <- 120

RandomAgentNoise_f <- function(rate, noise) {

  choice <- rbinom(1, 1, rate) # generating noiseless choices
  
  if (rbinom(1, 1, noise) == 1) {
    choice = rbinom(1, 1, 0.5) # introducing noise
  }
  
  return(choice)
}

d <- NULL

for (noise in seq(0, 0.5, 0.1)) { # looping through noise levels

  for (rate in seq(0, 1, 0.1)) { # looping through rate levels
    randomChoice <- rep(NA, trials)
    
    for (t in seq(trials)) { # looping through trials (to make it homologous to more reactive models)
      randomChoice[t] <- RandomAgentNoise_f(rate, noise)
    }
    temp <- tibble(trial = seq(trials), choice = randomChoice, rate, noise)
    temp$cumulativerate <- cumsum(temp$choice) / seq_along(temp$choice)

    if (exists("d")) {
      d <- rbind(d, temp)
    } else{
      d <- temp
    }
  }
}

write_csv(d, "W3_randomnoise.csv")

# Now we visualize it 
p1 <- ggplot(d, aes(trial, cumulativerate, group = rate, color = rate)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dashed") + 
  ylim(0,1) + 
  facet_wrap(.~noise) + 
  theme_classic()

## 4.3 Building our basic model in Stan

N.B. Refer to the video and slides for the step by step build-up of the Stan code.

Now we subset to a simple case, no noise and rate of 0.8, to focus on the Stan model. We make it into the right format for Stan, build the Stan model, and fit it.

### 4.3.1 Data

Here we define the data and format it for Stan. Stan likes data as a list. Why a list? Well, dataframes (now tibbles) are amazing. But they have a big drawback: they require each variable to have the same length. Lists do not have that limitation, they are more flexible. So, lists. Weâ€™ll have to learn how to live with them.

```{r}

d1 <- d %>% subset(noise == 0 & rate == 0.8)

## Create the data. N.B. note the two variables have different lengths: 1 for n, n for h.
data <- list(
  n = 120,  # n of trials
  h = d1$choice # sequence of choices (h stands for hand)
)
```

```{r}

# So now we create a an agent that interacts with d1$choice using the Rescorla-Wagner rule

# Function to simulate data from a one-armed bandit using the Rescorla-Wagner model
simulate_bandit <- function(num_trials, reward_probs, alpha) {
  # Initialize variables
  num_arms <- length(reward_probs)
  values <- rep(0, num_arms)
  choices <- numeric(num_trials)
  rewards <- numeric(num_trials)
  
  # Simulation loop
  for (trial in 1:num_trials) {
    # Choose an arm based on current value estimates
    choice <- sample(1:num_arms, 1)
    choices[trial] <- choice
    
    # Generate reward based on chosen arm's probability
    reward <- as.numeric(runif(1) < reward_probs[choice])
    rewards[trial] <- reward
    
    # Update value estimate for chosen arm
    prediction_error <- reward - values[choice]
    values[choice] <- values[choice] + alpha * prediction_error
  }
  
  # Return simulated choices and rewards
  return(list(choices = choices, rewards = rewards))
}

# Set parameters
num_trials <- 1000  # Number of trials
reward_probs <- c(0.2, 0.8)  # Reward probabilities for each arm
alpha <- 0.1  # Learning rate

# Simulate data
sim_data <- simulate_bandit(num_trials, reward_probs, alpha)

# Plot choices and rewards over trials
plot(1:num_trials, sim_data$rewards, type = "l", col = "blue", xlab = "Trial", ylab = "Reward", main = "Rewards over Trials")
lines(1:num_trials, sim_data$choices, col = "red")
legend("topright", legend = c("Rewards", "Choices"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)


```
